# Welcome to Python program Annotation Documentation

## Project aim

Annotating the sentences provided in [the annotation website](https://nlvr-annotation.web.app/) with Python programs. 

## Getting started

This doc provides the documentation for the NLVR Python program annotation, and contains 3 pages you may find useful.

- [Utility functions](utility-functions.md) - functions you may use to write the Python programs
- [Data structure](data-structure.md) - data structure of the image with methods that may be used
- [Preloaded variables](variables.md) - some variables already provided

**Note**: 
If there is any sentence you think you cannot annotate with the provided functions, please do **not** add extra-functions, but reach out to us via the contact information below and/or leave a comment in the annotation tool.

## Contacts

If you have any questions, please contact Anne Wu at aw588@cornell.edu.
